On powerup the Lotus boards will go to their default state.
The software/API should send all the required parameters to the Lotus Hardware before starting acquisition  or stimulation.

Typical Proceedure for recording Data
1) Find the Hardware: 
	Use FindAcquisitionHardware, FindStimulationHardware, FindControlHardware
2) Read the Self Check values from the Hardware:
	ReportAcquisitionSelfCheck, ReportStimulatorSelfCheck, ReportControlSelfCheck
3) If 1-wire information about the cables is require:
	call SetConnCheckStimPorts  and SetConnCheckAcqPorts( this is no longer needed as the acquisition board does not use 1-wire )
	Then call GetStimChannelInfo
4) Get Impedance if needed
	GetAcquisitionChannelImpedance and GetStimChannelImpedance
5) Setup the stimulator protocol to be used.
	If the stimulator channel is not used it needs to be turned offusing SetStimulatorOff
	For the stimulator channels being used set up the stimulator using SetStimulationParameters
		CStimulationTrain contains all the settings required for setting up the stimulator.
		If want to start the stimulator when the recoring starts: set m_start_with_recording to true.
		if m_start_with_recording is set to false, the stimulator will not start automatically.
		You can start the stimulator at any time by choosing: FireStimulator

		The stimulation protocol is a Train of pulses, if you want a continous train then you need to set the m_num_trains to 0.
		In the Auto mode, set the m_start_with_recording = true and m_num_trains = 0;
		In Manual mode, set m_start_with_recording = false;  then you can use FireStimulator to start the stimulator. 
		
6)	SetAcquisitionParameters
7) Start Recording Data using 	StartAcq()
8) Read data from the device using : ReadDataFromDevice
9) Fire the stimulator manually if needed
10) Stop Recording
11) Close the devices.
