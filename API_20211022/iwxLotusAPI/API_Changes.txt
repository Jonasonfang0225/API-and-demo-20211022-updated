Lotus API changes:
8/31/2021 FlipLoff(): to flip  the direction of the leadoff current. 
8/25/2021: Added AcqSetLoffCurrentFreq  to allow the Application to control the current andd frequency for measuring the impedance
3/29/20201:  Added second harmonic to the notch filter
             Stim1 and Stim2 amplitude controlled fixed.
			 Increased Online USB buffer to 16M bytes, which should be enough for 16 seconds of 16 channels of data at 16k
3/26/2021:  fixed stimulator amplitude update  during recording
			Stimulator output at low amplitude. 
			Stimulator feedback cleaned up in fimware.
3/23/2021:  The offset calibration of the acquisition board can now be saved in Firmware.  The acquisition Impedance calculation function has been changed. 
			SetAcquisitionImpedanceOffset();  and GetAcquisitionImpedanceOffset(float* ch_impedance_offset); functions have been added to the API
			The acquisition impedance function has been changed in the console application. 
			We are not sure if a single point cal is enough for the impedance measurements, or if we need to do a 2 point cal 
3/16/21: Changed the SetControlStimulatorParameters  function so that the function waits for the thread to send the data down to the device.
         This allows to get a better notification if the control module is disconnected.  The draw back is that the function has to wait for 100msec
		 before returning since the Control thread only send data to the control module every 100msec.
3/10/21:  Change Closed Device to have void return:
		   SetControlStimulatorParameters should report error if disconnected
		   SetAcquisitionParameters should report error if disconnected
3/8/2021:  Added example in the console applicaton to show the information from the status bits
